# Chroni-DigitalNoteTaker

This simple Python application allows users to log notes along with the current date and time into a text file.
How to Use

    Run the Python script.
    The program will prompt you to enter a note and ask if you want to log it (Y/N).
    If you choose to log the note, it will be appended to the "userlogs.txt" file along with the current date and time.
    You can view the logged notes in the "userlogs.txt" file.

Dependencies

This app relies on the datetime module, which is a standard Python library for working with dates and times.
